# CRMS - Change Request Management System
This is a complete change management tool, designed for use on cellular tellecommunications optimisation projects, but it could actually be used anywhere.  It is simply email based where users interact with a server to request or send information, which is then processed (or rejected with a reason) and sent to the next person in the chain.  All change data and status data is stored in a mysql DB.  The tool is fully autonomous and can be updated from an administrator email.  Users self register and the admin will verify their position which will give them rights to create or approve changes.
