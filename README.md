# CRMS - Change Request Management System
This is a proof of concept, change management tool, designed for use on cellular tellecommunications optimisation projects, but it could actually be used anywhere.  It is email based where users interact with a server to request or send information, which is then processed (or rejected with a reason) and sent to the next person in the chain.  All change data and status data is stored in a mysql DB in several forms, the main being an accumulating snapshot, which is ideal for tracking processes.  The tool is fully autonomous and can be updated from an administrator email.  Users self register and the admin will verify their position which will give them rights to create or approve changes.  The code basically checks an email server for new emails, once it finds some emails, it processes them sequentially, looking for key instruction text in the header or body as well as any required attachments.  It then acts based on each email, either opening a CR, moving a CR to the next point in the chain, rejecting the email or performing DB queries for the management or admin.  All users need to be registered with certain rights, which they do by sending in an email, which is then sent to a designated manager for approval and then they are added to the user DB.

*  It uses XL spreadsheets to send/receive CRs because that is what telco corporates like to use, Web interfaces with clunky fields that you have to enter data into one by one with dropdown menus were not acceptable.
*  It uses mySQL for the back end DB, because it's free and easy to use.
*  It uses .NET as the application software, because I was messing around with .NET at the time.

I wrote it as the project I was on was suffering from the chaos of too many engineers touching a live cellular network without adequate change management, this is a common problem in cellular.  I had a upper level sponsor to support me and encourage me, it was a good experience in coding.  Unfortunately, I had no other coding partners and project was quite large, the codebase ended up at around 10K lines of custom code.  Basically, the code needs to be completely re-designed and re-written, possibly in another language, with the overall goals of maintainability and functionality.  However, the basic functionality is sound, i.e. the code works great and that is the most important thing.  It was used on a live network for around 3 months before the vendor finally bit the bullet and allowed the project team to use one of their full fledged change management tools for free, which was our goal in the first place (to prod a stubborn management who were balking and waiting for someone to buy their tool).  

It is a great tool and I can see many usage cases in all industries that have processes to manage with many actors at many heirachical levels touching databases.  I would enjoy the challenge of resurrecting it one day with the help of some skilled collaborators in python or a more appropriate language and commercialising it.
